/**
 * A generic base class for views that draw some kind of spatial view of a group
 * of cells. Cell views have a default draw feature that draws a background for
 * the cell, using the cell color feature.
 * 
 * @author Miles Parker
 * @version 3.0
 * @history 3.0 Renamed from BaseCellView, extensive refactorings
 * @history 1.9 5/1/00 added support for cell customizer
 * @history 1.2.6 10/26/99 updated with better support for draw feature names
 * @history 1.1.2 5/17/99 added border support (replacing border cell draw
 *          method)
 * @history 1.0.1 1/13/99 added support for multiple draw features
 * @since 1.0
