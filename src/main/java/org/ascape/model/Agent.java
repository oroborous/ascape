/**
 * The base class for all modeled objects in ascape.
 * Note that an ascape agent is actually a superset of the general
 * understanding of a software 'agent'. Ascape agents need not be
 * mobile or autonomous, but are always capable of being so.
 * For instance, a lattice cell is a subclass of this class and within its
 * own lattice has no opportunity to move, obviously. The same cell, however,
 * may move upon some other lattice or collection of agents.
 * <BR>To represent agent state simply provide member variables along with
 * getters and setters in subclasses, and create StatCollectors to make aggregate values available.
 * To provide behavior add rules to the parent scape. A simple way to do this is to
 * override the <code>scapeCreated</code> method. There are a number of rules that
 * act simply to call a cooresponding method or methods in Agent. For instance,
 * <code>METABOLISM_RULE</code> will call the <code>metabolism</code> method on
 * the appropriate agents<BR>.
 * <code>ITERATE_RULE</code> is added to the parent scape by default, and calls the
 * <code>iterate</code> method, but it is typically preferrable to use more granular
 * and flexible rules. To get rid of this iterate rule, overide <code>scapeCreated</code>, or
 * call <code>clearRules</code> on the parent scape. You should do this whenever
 * agent level processing is not required for a given scape; it can take time to iterate
 * through some scapes, and there is no way for the engine to determine at runtime that
 * an iterate method is a non-op.
