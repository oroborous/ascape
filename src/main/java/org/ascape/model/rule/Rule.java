/**
 * An abstract base class for behaviors that can be iterated across agent
 * scapes or a single agent. You can subclass rule to provide any kind of
 * behavior you want for an agent. Often, rules will simply call agent member
 * functions. But, because rules aren't themselves member functions of agents,
 * they don't need to follow class inheritance rules, and they can be added,
 * removed and executed dynamically. In effect, they provide a kind of dynamic
 * method dispatch capability to the framework, and allow us to flexibly execute
 * methods upon collections of agents without needing to know anything about the
 * underlying structure of the collection or the method of execution. The system
 * is designed to be powerful, without imposing large performance or conceptual
 * costs. For many common tasks, you can use built-in rules. For example, if you
 * want to allow movement for your agents, you can add a standard movement rule
 * to the scape containing them. These rules are members of the Agent and Cell
 * classes.
 *
 * <pre>
 * scape.addRule(MOVEMENT_RULE);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Then, simply override the built-in agent movement rule.
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyAgent extends CellOccupant {
 * ...
 * public void movement() {
 * [Your movement code]
 * }
 * ...
 * }
 *
 * There are a number of rules that have behavior allready defined. (And more planned.)
 * For these ruels, you simply need to add them to  a scape. So to have you agents take a
 * random walk in any direction, simply add the random walk rule.
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * scape.addRule(RANDOM_WALK_RULE);
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * To create your own rules you can implement a rule as a straight-forward class. You may
 * want to do this if there is significant state that is kept as part of the rule, as we do
 * for our stat collector and value setter rules, or if you want to extend rules in different
 * ways. But typically, rules are implemented as inner classes, static member classes or
 * anoymous inner classes.
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * scape.addRule(new Rule(&quot;Update Radius &amp; ExecutionStrategy&quot;) {
 * public void execute(Agent agent) {
 * ((NormCell) agent).updateRadius();
 * ((NormCell) agent).updateStrategy();
 * }
 * });
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * Information about the rule provided by the isRandomExecution and isCauseDelete is used by
 * the scape execution methods to optimize rule execution. The default behavior is conservative,
 * that is, rules are assumed to need random execution and potentially cause deletion in their
 * parent scapes. For better performance, if your rules do not need to be executed randomly (typically
 * because their outcomes do not affect other agents and/or are not affected by execution order),
 * or cannot cause an agent to be deleted, you should override these methods and return false.
