/**
 * Collects and stores aggregate statistics on some data source for every specified measurement type
 * of that source, and for each succesive measurement of that source, while that source meets some condition.
 * See StatCollector documentation for a discussion of how to use stat collectors.
 * Conditional stat collectors allow you to specifiy a condition that must be met for a statistic to be measured for
 * an object. In Ascape, they are useful in cases where you want to collect statistics automatically, but you want to
 * restrict the statistic to some subpopulation of a scape.
 * The following example creates an anonymous class that gathers age statistics for agents with wealth over 50,000, and adds
 * it to the parent scape so it can be collected.
 * <pre>
 * scape.addStatCollector(new StatCollectorCSA("Age") {
 *    public boolean meetsCondition(Object object) {
 *         return ((AnObjectWithWealth) object).getWealth() >= 50000;
 *    }
 *    public double getValue(Object object) {
 *         return ((AnObjectWithAge) object).getAge();
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
