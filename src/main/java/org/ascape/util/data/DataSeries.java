/**
 * A class which stores the results of measurements of data points. Comprehensive statistics are kept
 * for the series as a whole. Ordinarily, you should not have to work with this class
 * unless you are creating custom measurement types or collecting different kinds of
 * data. You do not usually need to subclass this class directly; a stat factory
 * creates the appropriate implementations.
 * Confused? A data series keeps track of the overall count, sum, average, minimum, maximum
 * for every piece of data collected, so it 'is-a' StatCollectorCSAMM. But it keeps the data stat for
 * that data as well, and it records just one measure of that stat, be it count, sum, average, minimum,
 * maximum, etc. so it 'has-a' DataPoint.
 * See StatCollectorCSA for an example.
