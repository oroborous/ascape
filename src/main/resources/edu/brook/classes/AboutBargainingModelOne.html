The essential idea of this model is to show how norms can emerge spontaneously at the social level from the decentralized interactions of many individuals that cumulate over time into a set of social expectations. Due to the self-reinforcing nature of the process, these expectations tend to perpetuate for long periods of time, even though they may have arisen from purely random events and have no a priori justification.
