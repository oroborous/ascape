The Artificial Anasazi Project is an agent-based modeling study based on the Sugarscape model created by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell (Epstein and Axtell 1996).  The Project was created to provide an empirical, "real-world" evaluation of the principles and procedures embodied in the Sugarscape model and to explore the ways in which bottom-up, agent based computer simulations can illuminate human behavior in a real-world setting.  In this case, the actual "test-bed" is prehistoric Long House Valley in northeastern Arizona, which, between roughly 1800 B.C. and A.D. 1300, was occupied by the Kayenta Anasazi, a regionally distinct prehistoric precursor of the modern pueblo cultures of the Colorado Plateau.

This implementation of the Long House Valley model is a Java version of a model first developed in C++ by Steven McCarroll and Miles Parker.
