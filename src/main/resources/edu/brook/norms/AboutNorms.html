This model posits a ring of interacting agents. Each agent occupies a fixed position on the ring and is an object characterized by two attributes. One attribute is the agent's "norm," which in this model is binary. We may think of these as "drive on the right (R) vs. drive on the left (L)." Initially, agents are assigned norms. Then, of course, agents update their norms based on observation of agents within some sampling radius. This radius is the second attribute and is heterogeneous across agents. An agent with a sampling radius of 5 takes data on the five agents to his left and the five agents to his right. Agents update, or "adapt," their sampling radii incrementally according to a simple Radius Update Rule.
