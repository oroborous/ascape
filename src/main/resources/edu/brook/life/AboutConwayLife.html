<b>An implementation of John Conway's 'Life'</b><BR>
<BR><BR>
In this classic cellular automata, very simple life and death rules create interesting and dynamic patterns that seem quite life-like. This class is intended to demonstrate a few important aspects of Ascape. First it show how a simple CA can be easily constructed with a minimum amount of specification and programming. It also shows how rules allow agent behaviors (mehtods) to be decoupled from agent class definition, and made selectable and dispatchable across collections at runtime. Understanding this concept is crucial to an understanding of how Ascape works. Finally, it demonstrates how synchronous updating of rules can be achieved through the use of Ascape's "execute, then update" rule. The importance of the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous updating should not be overlooked. To see this, try modifying the source code so that it uses the asynchronous rule instead.
