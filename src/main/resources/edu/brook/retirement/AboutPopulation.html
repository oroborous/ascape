In this model of retirement decision-making a relatively small number of agents are rational. Such agents
behave as if they compute the optimal age at which to retire. A
small proportion of agents retire at random. A majority of the
population engages in imitative behavior. An imitative agent
retires once a certain fraction of the agents in its social network
have retired.
